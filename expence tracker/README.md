# Expense Tracker

### Developed by Dev Kumar | Internship Project at Hex Software

This is a simple **Expense Tracker** application built using Python and PyQt5. The tool allows users to track their expenses by entering the amount, category, and date of each expense. It stores the data in a CSV file and displays the recorded expenses in a table.

## Features

- **Add Expense**: Enter the amount, category, and date of an expense.
- **Display Expenses**: The table displays all previously recorded expenses.
- **CSV Storage**: Expenses are stored in a CSV file (`expenses.csv`), ensuring data persistence across sessions.

- PyQt5 (`pip install pyqt5`)
